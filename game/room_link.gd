class_name RoomLink
extends Node

## The four remote calls this game needs, on one node that exists on both ends.
##
## [b]Why one class rather than a server half and a client half.[/b] Godot refuses an RPC
## unless both ends declare the [i]same set[/i] of [code]@rpc[/code] methods — it compares
## a checksum over them — and it routes the call by the receiver's node path relative to
## its [MultiplayerAPI] root. dot-server learned this the expensive way: putting chat's
## two methods on [DotClientLink] instead of on a mirrored child broke the paths [i]and[/i]
## changed the checksum, so every RPC between client and server was refused, handshake
## included, with a timeout as the only symptom.
##
## Using literally the same script on both sides makes the checksum identical by
## construction. All that is left is the path, and that is why this node is named the same
## on both ends and parented to the node that is itself named the same on both ends —
## [DotServer] on one side and [DotClientLink] on the other, both called
## [code]Server[/code].
##
## [codeblock]
## Server            <- DotServer, or DotClientLink named to match
##   Chat            <- DotChatManager / DotClientChat
##   Room            <- this, on both
## [/codeblock]

const CHANNEL := "room.link"

## The node name both ends must use. It is the routing, so it is a constant.
const NODE_NAME := &"Room"

## Everything here rides [constant DotTransport.Channel.STATE], which dot-server reserves
## for exactly this and uses for nothing itself. Sharing chat's channel would make a burst
## of snapshots delay a chat line — which in a room whose entire point is the chat is the
## one delay anybody would notice.

## [code]input[/code] or [code]request[/code].
##
## A test seam, and the only way this netcode can be checked deterministically: a real
## socket does not reproduce the same latency, reordering and loss twice. Unset — which is
## every real deployment — every send goes out as an RPC.

# --- Receiving -------------------------------------------------------------

## State from the authority. Unreliable: a newer snapshot supersedes a lost one, and
## resending a hundred-millisecond-old position is worse than useless.
##
## Note that over WebSocket — which is every browser client, and therefore every client
## on a server that has one — this is delivered reliably and in order anyway. That is a
## property of TCP rather than a gap here, and it is why the snapshot rate is 15 and not
## 60: fewer, larger, self-contained updates degrade more gracefully on a stream that
## cannot drop one.
